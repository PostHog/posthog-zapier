# PostHog x Zapier

Connect PostHog with _thousands_ of services through Zapier.

This integration provides two steps you can use in Zaps:

- **Action Performed** trigger, which fires when a selected PostHog action is performed, with the associated event as the payload.
- **Capture Event** action, which allows you to send events to PostHog.
